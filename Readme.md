# Particle system

The goal of this project was to simulate and display a high number of particle (several millions) using OpenGL and cuda.

## Requirements

The project uses GLAD and GLFW and OpenGL 4.6 Core.

It is compiled assuming Cuda compute capabilities 8.X.

### Glad link

If glad is not installed on the machine, it can be installed locally.

If the link in the Makefile expired, a new one can be generated with
https://gen.glad.sh/#generator=c&api=gl%3D4.6&profile=gl%3Dcore%2Cgles1%3Dcommon
